## 🥰 Acknowledgements

Special thanks to [NotchNook](https://lo.cafe/notchnook) for the original idea. I created this project as a free and open-source alternative, focusing on the features I personally need and improving some issues. Since NotchNook wasn't compatible with my essential iBar app, I developed my own version to ensure better compatibility, while simplifying the functionality to suit my needs.
